Group project for the AD320 - Web Development clas at North Seattle College (Winter2021)

Assignment was to create a React app for a Hot Dog cart business, with different views for Customer, Vendor, and System Admin.

Customers can view a map, see nearby carts, examine cart details including current menu items, and place orders for pickup.

Vendors can see incoming orders, mark orders complete, and adjust their inventory.

System Admins can see all menu, cart, and customer details, can create new carts and menu items, edit them or delete them.
